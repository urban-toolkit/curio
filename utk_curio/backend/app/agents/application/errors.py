"""The application-layer error every agent use case raises; routes map it to a JSON status.

Application layer of the agents package (memo dev/142, B2; re-derived on enh/agent-catalog): cut from
``services.py`` by responsibility; every function keeps its name and body. Sibling modules are reached
module-qualified (``agents_<module>.name``) so a test that patches the owner is seen by every caller,
and import order between siblings cannot matter.
